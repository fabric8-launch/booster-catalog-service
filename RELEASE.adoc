== Release Instructions

=== Done manually on local development machines until we have this on a parameterized CI build

Let Maven do component upgrades and version bumping. Assuming that `X` is the released version, after the command below is executed, you should have a `vX` tag and the pom.xml will be `X+1-SNAPSHOT`

```
mvn release:prepare release:perform -B
```
